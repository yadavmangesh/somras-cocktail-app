### How to Run the App

The app uses The Cocktail DB as the data source, it uses some of the v2 version of the APIs provided by The Cocktail DB. You can also use the v1 version for free, but some of the APIs are only available in the v2 version. Signup as a Patreon supporter to get your v2 API key just for 2$ (146 ₹). You can cancel any time if you don’t want to support monthly, you still can continue to use the same API key.
